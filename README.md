# image-to-poem

A repository for generating poems from images using deep learning.


## Data

This project uses the [Kaggle Poems data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michaelarman/poemsdataset/data?select=topics) which contains around 100 poems for 144 different topics, resulting in almost 14400 poems. Additional data for training can be found in the [Github implementation](https://github.com/arthurdjn/img2poem-pytorch) of [Beyond Narrative Description: Generating Poetry from Images by Multi-Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08473.pdf) which includes 93264 poems. This data set also contains links for images with associated poems. We will use these images as our input data.
